    <p> My favorite culture that I am not native to would be the Hispanic
        culture. I have some family that is Hispanic so I like to bond with
        them over that. It also comes in handy for my job.</p>
    <p> Hedy Lamarr is someone I look up to since she was able to develop a
        secret communications language during WW2, and Rosa Parks is the other
        since she was never scared to stand up for what she wanted.</p>
    <p> A meal that I think represents me is lasagna since it'll always
        be one of my favorites.</p>
    <p> I feel most creative when I'm with my friends.</p>
